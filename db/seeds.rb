If I was to do it again, I'd start at the end and work my way back into the city. Suggest subway and short walk out to the memorial and follow the route back in. This would lead you to a decent pit stop at Quincy then ending up at the park for ice cream.

  {title: "Wow, rude emmployees", body: "The hotel is fine. In a good location, but I was not at all impressed by the employees. My problem started when I called to order room service and they called back in a few minutes letting me know that one item was unavailable. I said ok, I will look at the menu and call back. Before I even had a chance to look at the menu, another person from room service calls back demanding that I place my order or else they might need to make two trips. I said that I had not looked at the menu and needed more time. They replied I had to order right then, so I canceled the whole order. Later I spoke with the hotel manager and he told me the whole thing was a miscommunication. There was no miscommunication, but even if there was, a simple apology would have squashed it. Instead I left feeling like I was a problem for them. This may seem small and it is, but I felt like I wasn’t treated like a guest and I wasn’t taken seriously at all by the management. I was and am very disappointed by the employees at this hotel. I wished I had stayed somewhere else.", rating: 1, place_id: 3, user_id: 1},

How about the dated technology and obsolete interface. If you can pay $14 admission sure you have a smart phone with a lot more capability for learning, entertaining and interact with information than you will find here. If all you want is to get your kids tired, well a walk in the park is the way to go and more importantly, it is free and plus, you can have a snack or a drink while you are at it.

  {title: "boring", body: "Today we visited the Children's Museum and we were extremely disappointed. The museum and the exhibits were old, dirty and run-down. I have a 3 year old and 11 month old. The exhibits did not keep my 3 year olds attention for more then 30 seconds. The staff was nonexistent throughout the exhibits. We had a bad experience in the art room when my daughter swallowed paint. The art teacher could have cared less. She watched as my daughter cried and I caught her rolling her eyes. The baby space room was missing toys and the dolls and play clothes were disgusting and old. There just wasn't enough interaction for children. The whole museum needs to be updated with new technology, create new hands on exhibits and cleaned from top to bottom. They should take a look at the Science Museum or Walt Disney World.

  {title: "Steep Entry Fee", body: "At $25 with a AAA discount this site is not cheap. The program begins with costumed actors outlining the events leading up to the tea party. After this you board the ship and another actor discusses the events as they occurred aboard ship the evening of the tea party. Guests are then invited to throw symbolically overboard some boxes of tea re-enacting the event. You are then led down to the cargo hold where the tea was stored on board during the overseas voyage. Unfortunately on the day of my visit the fire alarm sounded and everyone was taken off the ship to the museum. There followed a holographic presentation outlining a conversation between a loyalist and “revolutionary” then a short movie describing Paul Reveres ride and the events leading up to and ultimately culminating in the battles at Lexington and Concord. At no point was there any attempt to re-board the ship to finish that part of the tour. In lieu of that everyone was offered a free cup of tea in the tea room upstairs. I think it was an overall good presentation, the actors were knowledgeable and enthusiastic and encouraged participation from the guests. However it was very expensive. It was the most that I paid for any historic site in town.", rating: 1, place_id: 4, user_id: 1},

  {title: "Great Art, Horrible Custom Service", body: "This attraction is the essence of being run by people who are clueless about visitor experience but smart about art. The museum is laid out horrendously. Galleries are not marked well. The headphones are useless and half strangle you. It is not handicap friendly. The layout inside each gallery encourages bottle necks so that you're either suffocating in a crowd or in a nearly empty space. The security guards are rude and unhelpful, as are the staff generally, especially the restaurant staff. Bathrooms are oddly positioned. There's only one completely out of the way staircase to access the various floors. Worst of all, to exit several galleries you must exit the museum itself, being forced to show your tickets multiple times after waiting in multiple lines just to keep seeing the museum. I work in the tourism industry and cannot imagine an attraction screwing up in more ways than this one. I feel that for $25 I shouldn't have to fight to see the art, but that was the entirety of my experience. This museum needs to seriously overhaul its philosophy about customer service.

  {title: "Where you can feel like Ferris Bueller", body: "The MOFA in Boston is such a great place to visit. You could actually spend hours in there and still not see everything there is to see. Then you can go back the next day or next weekend and you'll see things that you didn't see the first time. Now I am no art snob, nor an art critic or any other kind of art aficionado, but this is one place I love to walk around, often only to find myself standing and studying the paint strokes and intricate details of a priceless painting or the colored threads intertwining with such perfection to create a master tapestry. I can do this all day long. I guess I just like to stand and listen for what I think the art speaks to me. Well, maybe that's just me. I know, I'm a weirdo, or so I've been told. \nI don't know why, but it feels like a holy church of art and it deserves a hallowed reverence. So that's my token of appreciation to the timeless halls of the MOFA in Boston. \nGo early in the day or later in the afternoon. Less crowds and less little ones being a distraction.
